Mystery of the missing cat Yumyum ðŸ˜º

About a year ago the cat Yumyum was reported missing by his mother Skrollan. The exact date was 7th of July 2018 when  Skrollan contacted the police station in Sphynxtown and the investigation was started. The investigators didnâ€™t come very far in solving this mysterious case. Yumyumâ€™s body still hasnâ€™t been found and the police have closed the case and concluded that Yumyum is dead and given up. Apparently they donâ€™t prioritize cat murders, understandable since the police chief is a german shepherd. But  Skrollan on the other hand can not let this go, she needs to find out what happened to her son.  To her help she now has inspector Basil, an experienced British Shorthair from Oxford who will help to try and solve the mystery.
The police did establish a report and a crime scene where they said the murder took place. The crime scene  takes us to a playground near Bakersyard where police inspectors found Yumyums DNA in a dried splash of bloodðŸ©¸ right next to a small sandbox.
