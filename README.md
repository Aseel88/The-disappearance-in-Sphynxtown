## The plot of the story
About a year ago the cat Yumyum was reported missing by his mother Skrollan. The exact date was 7th of July 2018 when Skrollan contacted the police station in Sphynxtown and the investigation was started. The investigators didnâ€™t get very far in solving this mystery. Yumyum still hasnâ€™t been found and the police have already closed the case and concluded that Yumyum is most likely dead. Apparently they donâ€™t prioritize cat murders, which might be understandable since the police chief is a german shepherd.

Skrollan on the other hand can't let this go, she needs to find out what happened to her son. To her help she now has inspector Basil, an experienced British Shorthair from Oxford who will help to try and solve the mystery.
The police established a report of the location from where Yamyam was last seen. The spot is located at a playground near Bakersyard. Officer Shepherd also found Yumyums DNA in a dried splash of bloodðŸ©¸ right next to a small sandbox. There has to be more to this story..
